# Luminespire
 Code Golf Explanation Assistant

Currently, this is a first-stage MVP of Luminespire. It's written in vanilla JS, looks horrible, and is missing a lot of quality-of-life features.

Gradually, it will be written in Svelte, and have things like:

- Adding characters to the program without disrupting indices of characters/characters in groups
- Removing characters from the program without disrupting indices of characters/characters in groups (where possible)
- Click-and-drag selection of characters to put in a group
- Import explanation from text
- Import program from vyxal permalink
