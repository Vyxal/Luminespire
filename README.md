Luminespire is a language agnostic code golf explanation generator tool. If you've ever tried to write
an explanation for a long code golf answer, especially for a lanauge with characters that aren't all
single width, then you'll know that getting things perfectly aligned isn't the easiest thing to do.

That's where Luminespire comes in; you give it your program, tell it what characters go on which lines,
and explain each line. The tool handles formatting for you! It'll ensure that there's the correct amount
of spaces for each line, and even handle multi-line lines for you.

## How To Use

1. Paste your program into the program box.
2. Add lines to the explanation via the "Add Line" button. These act as different lines in the explanation
3. To change the currently selected line of explanation, click in the explanation box for that line.
4. To add characters to a line of explanation, you can either click the individual character or click and
   drag over a range. If selecting a range, click the "Toggle Characters" button to add that range to the
   currently selected line.
5. You can change the explanation line order by dragging the line boxes around.

## Generated Explanation

The formatted explanation generated by Luminespire will look something like so:

```
\`\`\`
Your Code Here
Your           # Some sort of Text
     Code      # More text
          Here # Final bit of text
ðŸ’Ž
\`\`\`
Created with the help of [Luminespire](https://vyxal.github.io/Luminespire)
```

Everything in the code-fence must be kept-as is, including the `ðŸ’Ž`. 
That's because there are invisible characters at the end of each line of explanation.
These characters serve as meta-data in case you wish to import your explanation
into the tool to edit it. The `ðŸ’Ž` acts as a selection point to select the entire 
explanation without missing any invisible characters.
